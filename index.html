        <h2>| The purpose of IT in modern business</h2>

        <p><b>1.1</b> In this modern age of cyber attacks on both big and small companies having a good IT
            infrastructure in place is vital. With recent company data breaches from the likes of Facebook,
            Google and others its important to have strong regulations in place to protect users data stored by software
            and on devices, especially when
            access to cameras or microphones have been granted.
        </p>

        <h2>| How to complete a successful digital projects</h2>

        <p><b>1.2</b> Have a clear understanding of the scope of the project by getting as much info as possible. Know
            the purpose and the target audience the projects geared towards. As for tools, I'd recommend using something
            standard you and others are comfortable with, unless specifically requested by a client. Do your research,
            do mockups, set out a budget for things needed and get the clients approval. If you create a timeline for
            tasks and factor in additional time for testing before agreeing a deadline and costs, this will aid in
            completing a successful project. It also helps if you have the patience of a saint.</p>

    <div class="text">
        <h2>| Planning and carrying out task using IT</h2>

        <p><b>1.3</b> Trello as its an easy to use organiser for planning your website as you can collect tasks into
            lists while still viewing your entire day and track your time. Visual Studio Code to combine your HTML, CSS
            and JavaScript files. And a GitHub Repository to share your files.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <h2>| Risks that might impact a digital project</h2>

        <p><b>1.4</b> Project management is so important. Plan each task and allocate enough time needed for designers
            and developers to complete those tasks. Not allowing yourself enough time to run numerous test on different
            platforms to work out bugs causes digital projects to fail.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <h2>| Using IT systems and software</h2>

        <p><b>1.5</b> It's important to select an IT system and software that's supported and used by everyone. Like
            HTML and CSS, to prevent problems that can arise by using something that's just been released as the last
            thing you need is to get stuck.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <h2>| The outcome of chosen technology</h2>

        <p><b>1.6</b> Developers say once you understanding HTML and CSS they opens up the web to you. Even though HTML
            and CSS can seen like hieroglyphics as first but once you understand what they do and how they work you'll
            have the basic understanding of how the entire internet works and functions. It no surprise they are the
            cornerstone technologies used to create web pages and web applications for the World Wide Web.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <h2>| The legal guidelines that impact digital projects</h2>

        <p><b>1.7</b> The General Data Protection Regulation's legal guidelines impact digital projects as the
            collection of this data is used for services and data processing. Failing to comply to the new guidelines
            when creating digital projects without showing and requesting the appropriate consent will result in
            individuals and companies being find.

        <h2>| Website Review</h2>

        <p><b>2.1</b> I found it really useful to use Trello as it helped me to plan out tasks that I needed to do and
            also see how other designers used it when creating similar projects. As for Visual Studio Code, I see why
            it's very popular as after using it for just over a week I'm starting to understand it. I also love some of
            the additional extensions available to use too. Considering that I've never done coding before I'm happy
            with the tools used to create my website.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2.2</b> Trello is good, but I wouldn't say it was appropriate. As for Visual Studio Code, this was
            appropriate
            to complete the website's coding in both HTML and CSS.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2.3</b> I'm happy with my website as creating it helped me to understand and appreciate front end coding,
            especially being completely new to coding and this being the very first website I've ever done. I know one
            of my weaknesses presently is JavaScript, but I know with more practice I'll get better.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>2.4</b> Further improvements that I would have liked to have done would be creating a fullscreen video
            background as they seem to be the trend these days. I would have also loved to have been able to create my
            own Photoshop elements instead of using online elements.

        <p><b>Note:</b> Putting a copyright notice on the bottom of a website or blog is a form of protection as it
            states that the material displayed is not to be used without the permission of the owner. In fact, you don't
            even need the notice to claim copyright as the law eliminated the requirement of public notice in 1989. As
